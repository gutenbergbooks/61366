<p>The occasion is taken to acknowledge the kind consideration that the
first edition of this little work has received. This edition appears
in a thoroughly revised and much enlarged form; to what extent, may be
judged by the fact that chapters on The Physician, Surgery, Physiology,
Anatomy and Pharmacy have been added, together with many allusions to
the other medical subjects, making an increase of over four hundred
quotations. It has been impossible to resist the temptation of adding
a few medical thoughts from other authors, which will be found under
their appropriate heads. The labor necessary to accomplish this has
not interfered in any way with professional duties; it being a task
entirely of the leisure hours of the night.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>PART I.<br /> <span class="h_subtitle">THE PHYSICIAN.</span></h2></div>

<p>Shakespeare’s education was not, by any means, hedged in by plots and
characters; besides these, his mighty mind seems to have teemed with
the knowledge of languages, medicine, law and court etiquette. It is
wonderful that one brain could shine forth such a vast variety, and
surprising that he has even gone into the <i>minutiæ</i> of the different
avenues of learning through which he has stridden. Shakespeare paid
considerable attention to medicine, and has furnished some of the
finest specimens of the medical character that have ever been drawn by
any writer. His Cerimon, in Pericles, is a most noble one. He speaks
for himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">’Tis known, I ever</span>
<span class="i0">Have studied physic, through which secret art,</span>
<span class="i0">By turning o’er authorities, I have</span>
<span class="i0">(Together with my practice,) made familiar</span>
<span class="i0">To me and to my aid, the bless’d infusions</span>
<span class="i0">That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;</span>
<span class="i0">And I can speak of the disturbances</span>
<span class="i0">That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me</span>
<span class="i0">A more content in course of true delight</span>
<span class="i0">Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,</span>
<span class="i0">Or tie my treasure up in silken bags</span>
<span class="i0">To please the fool and death.</span>
<span class="i42"><i>Act III., Sc. II.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And others speak of him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Hundreds call themselves</span>
<span class="i0">Your creatures, who by you have been restored:</span>
<span class="i0">And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even</span>
<span class="i0">Your purse, still open, hath built lord Cerimon</span>
<span class="i0">Such strong renown as time shall ne’er decay.</span>
<span class="i42"><i>Act III., Sc. II.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dowden says, “Cerimon, who is master of the secrets of nature, who is
liberal in his ‘learned charity,’ who held it ever</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">‘Virtue and cunning were endowments greater</span>
<span class="i4">Than nobleness and riches,’</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">is like a first study of Prospero;” while Furnivall thinks
that he represents to some extent the famous Stratford physician, Dr. John
Hall, who married Shakespeare’s eldest daughter Susanna.</p>

<p>What an excellent physician was Gerard de Narbon, Helena’s father, who
is referred to in All’s Well:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
This young gentlewoman had a father, whose skill was almost as great as
his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made Nature immortal,
and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king’s
sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king’s
disease. * * * * He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his right to be so. * * * The king * * * spoke of him admiringly and
mournfully: he was skillful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
could be set up against mortality.</p>

<p>In King Lear also appears a physician worthy of the name. The last
scene of the fourth act shows his excellent skill in treating Lear’s
case. Dr. Bucknill, of England, in writing of it twenty-five years ago,
says: “We confess, almost with shame, that although near two centuries
and a half have passed since Shakespeare thus wrote we have very little
to add to his method of treating the insane as thus pointed out.”</p>

<p>Dr. Butts, in Henry VIII, and Dr. Caius, in Merry Wives, play rather
unimportant parts. He compliments the profession by putting this speech
in the mouth of a madman:</p>

<p>Shakespeare certainly had the true idea of the great value of sleep,
and he also knew of its importance in the treatment of brain diseases.
Sleep serves as an excellent stimulant, promoting the growth of the
brain. The infant, during the first ten weeks of its life, sleeps most
of the time and hence during that period its brain is overdeveloped in
proportion to its size.</p>

<p>The accuracy with which Shakespeare has written of apoplexy is justly
alluded to in Bell’s <i>Principles of Surgery</i>, (1815, Vol. II, p. 557):
“My readers will smile, perhaps, to see me quoting Shakespeare among
physicians and theologists; but not one of all their tribe, populous
though it be, could describe so exquisitely the marks of apoplexy,
conspiring with the struggles for life, and the agonies of suffocation,
to deform the countenance of the dead: so curiously does our poet
present to our conception all the signs from which it might be inferred
that the good duke Humfrey had died a violent death.”

<p>Hysteria, in Shakespeare’s time, was considered a disease common to
both sexes, and was known as “<i>Hysterica passio</i>,” or more popularly
termed “the mother.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!</span>

<span class="i28"><i>King Lear, Act II., Sc. IV.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Percy thinks that Shakespeare read of this disease in Harsnet’s
“Declaration of Popish Impostures” while he was looking up material for
his character of Tom of Bedlam. The following is taken from (p. 25) the
work referred to: “Ma: Maynie had a spice of the <i>Hysterica passio</i> as
seems from his youth, hee himself termes it the <i>Moother</i>, and saith
that hee was much troubled with it in Fraunce, and that it was one of
the causes that mooved him to leave his holy order whereinto he was
initiated and to returne into England.”</p>

<p>Dyer in his “Folk-Lore of Shakespeare” quotes the following from Mr.
Timb’s “Mysteries of Life, Death, and Futurity,” (1861, p. 149.) “This
affection (broken heart) was, it is believed, first described by
Harvey; but since his day several cases have been observed. Morgagni
has recorded a few examples: among them, that of George II., who died
in 1760; and, what is very curious, he fell a victim to the same
malady. Dr. Elliotson, in his Lumleyan Lectures on Diseases of the
Heart, in 1839, stated that he had only seen one instance; but in
the ‘Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine’ Dr. Townsend gives a table of
twenty-five cases, collected from various authors.”</p>

<p>A very good case of syncope is presented in Pericles. “The cases of
apparent death, in which it is believed that premature interment
sometimes takes place, are of this kind. Instances have occurred in
which the pulse, respiration and consciousness have been absent for
several days, and yet the patient has ultimately recovered. The system
is in a sort of hybernation, in which vitality remains, though the
vital functions are suspended. It is probable that, in such cases, a
very careful auscultation might detect a slight sound in the heart.”
(Dr. George B. Wood’s Practice. 1858. Vol. II., p. 211.)</p>

<p>He has not forgotten the diseases affecting the digestive organs.</p>

<p>An old superstition regarding toothache was that it was caused by a
small worm, formed like an eel, which bored a hole into the tooth, and
various methods were employed to remove it. Dyer notes the fact that
John of Gatisden, one of the oldest medical authorities, attributed
decay of the teeth to this cause.</p>

<p>The examination of the urine as an aid to diagnosis has been
resorted to for many centuries, but the processes of to-day are, of
course, vastly different from and hardly to be compared with those
of earlier times, when blind ignorance caused urine-examining, or
“<i>water-casting</i>,” to be a mere mockery. The practice, says Dr.
Bucknill, arose “like the barber surgery, from the ecclesiastical
interdicts upon the medical vocations of the clergy. Priests and
monks, being unable to visit their former patients, are said first to
have resorted to the expedient of divining the malady, and directing
the treatment upon simple inspection of the urine.” The College of
Physicians, in an old statute, denounced it as belonging only to
charlatans, and members were not allowed to give advice on inspection
only. Shakespeare has frequently referred to it, as have also many
others of the old writers, who condemn strongly what was then a shallow
deception, but what has now become, by the light of knowledge, one of
the most important diagnostic aids to many diseases.</p>

<p>Plague has been alluded to frequently, but generally only the symptoms
of carbuncles and the petechiæ are mentioned. As the latter only
occur in very bad cases, they were called “God’s tokens,” and their
appearance denoted a fatal termination of the disease. Hence the home
of the patient was closed and “Lord have mercy on us” placed upon the door.

<p>Diseases of the absorbent system are well represented by scrofula, or
“King’s evil,” as it was known in Shakespeare’s time. This disease,
so called on account of the supposed power of cure being invested in
the handling and prayers of the king, was first so treated by Edward
the Confessor, in 1058, and by all the succeeding rulers until William
III., who refused. Queen Anne resumed the practice, but King George I.
put an end to it. During the twenty years following 1662 upwards of
100,000 persons were touched for the malady.</p>

<p>It would indeed be interesting to know the source of Shakespeare’s
knowledge on the physiological action of this alkaloid of tobacco. Most
true it is that he has selected an excellent drug for his purpose in
taking up the crude oil—Nicotia nin (hebenon). Birds will fall dead as
they approach it; one drop is sufficient to kill a dog; and man dies
in from two to five minutes after taking a poisonous dose: but the
drug produces death by the <i>failure of respiration</i>, not by its direct
action on the blood. “In nicotia-poisoning the blood is, however, not
perceptibly affected. The amount of the alkaloid necessary to take
life is exceedingly small, and although death by asphyxia causes the
vital fluid to be everywhere dark, yet the microscope reveals only
normal corpuscles. Moreover, Krocker has found that the dark blood
rapidly assumes an arterial hue when shaken in the air, and that its
spectrum is normal.” (H. C. Wood’s Toxicology, 1882, p. 370.) It is
thought by many that Shakespeare did not intend “hebenon” to mean the
alkaloid of tobacco, and very plausible arguments have been brought
forward to show that he meant hebon or the juice of the yew. Dyer, in
his chapter on plants, gives the following extract of a paper read by
Rev. W. A. Harrison before the New Shakespeare Society in 1882: “It
has been suggested that the poison intended by the Ghost in ‘Hamlet,’
(I-V.), when he speaks of the ‘juice of cursed hebenon,’ is that of
the yew, and is the same as Marlowe’s ‘juice of hebon.’ (Jew of Malta,
III-IV.) The yew is called hebon by Spenser and by other writers of
Shakespeare’s age; and in its various forms of eben, eiben, hiben,
etc., this tree is so named in no less than five different European
languages. From medical authorities, both of ancient and modern times,
it would seem that the juice of the yew is a rapidly fatal poison;
next, that the symptoms attending upon yew-poisoning correspond, in a
very remarkable manner, with those which follow the bites of poisonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
snakes; and, lastly, that no other poison but the yew produces the
lazar-like ulcerations on the body, upon which Shakespeare, in this
passage, lays so much stress.” From these arguments there seems to be
every reason for believing that Shakespeare did mean the juice of the
yew, and it is to be hoped that the continual harping on this subject,
as an evidence of his medical ignorance, will soon cease.</p>

<p>A solution of gold was supposed to possess great medical power; even
the actual contact of the pure metal, according to their belief,
kept the wearer ever in good health. Dyer quotes from John Wight’s
translation of the “Secrets of Alexis,” in which is given a receipt
“to dissolve and reducte golde into a potable licour which conserveth
the youth and healthe of a man, and will heale every disease that is
thought incurable in the space of seven daies at the furthest.” The
term “grand liquor,” as it appears in Shakespeare, refers to this solution.</p>

<p>Thus Swift predicted his own end as early as 1731. History mournfully
testifies that his candle burnt out as he anticipated. “Fits of lunacy
were succeeded by the <i>dementia</i> of old age. For three years he uttered
only a few words and broken interjections. He would often attempt to
speak, but could not recollect words to express his meaning, upon
which he would sigh heavily. Babylon in ruins (to use a <i>simile</i> of
Addison’s), was not a more melancholy spectacle than this wreck of a
mighty intellect! In speechless silence his spirit passed away October
19, 1745.” (Chamber’s Eng. Lit.)</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>PART III.<br /> <span class="h_subtitle">SURGERY.</span></h2></div>

<p>Shakespeare paid much more attention to the practice of medicine and
obstetrics than to surgery. Perhaps the cause of this was that at that
time surgery had not reached its present perfection. A more probable
reason is that his son-in-law, Dr. John Hall, may not have been a surgeon.</p>

<p>The symptoms of secondary and tertiary syphilis are accurately
expressed in this curse of Timon’s. Leprosy is referred to in the
sentence “hoar the flamen,” or in other words, make white the priest.
Shakespeare here shows a very fine point by using these most dreaded
of all diseases: leprosy, syphilis, and consumption—maladies that are
hereditary, incurable, and contagious. They are certainly lasting, as
he wishes the curse to be.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A pox on ’t!</i></p>

<p>A common expression scattered through many of his plays.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part
young limbs and lechery; but the gout galls the one, and the pox

<p>Dr. Macdonnell, of Canada, has thrown much light on these quotations
in his works on Syphilis. He says: “It appears to have been the custom
to prescribe for syphilitic patients, in addition to inunction, a
prolonged diaphoresis and a very low diet. On the continent the patient
was placed in a cave, oven, or dungeon, and Wiseman says it was the
custom in England to use a tub for this purpose.”</p>

<p>In the footnote to the passage in Johnson &amp; Steven’s edition of
Shakespeare’s works the following quotations from old plays are given:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“——you had better match a ruin’d bawd,</span>
<span class="i2">One ten times cur’d by sweating and the tub.”</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Again, in the <i>Family of Love</i>, (1608), a doctor says:</p>

<p class="center">“O for one of the hoops of my Cornelius’ tub,
I shall burst myself with laughing else.”</p>

<p>In <i>Monsieur d’Olive</i>, (1606):</p>

<p class="center">“Our embassage is into France, there may be employment for thee:

<p>A little attention is paid to diseases of the eye, thus in Winter’s Tale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Commentators have the thought that Shakespeare wished to express the
idea of cataract by the term pin and web—this is, without doubt, a
mistake; he did not intend to make lovers so cruel that they should
desire to deprive every one else of sight. Pin and web (being a
varicose excrescence of the conjunctiva, sometimes to such an extent as
to totally prevent vision), was meant to express a veil, or in other
words, the eyelid.</p>

<p>Obstetrics was Shakespeare’s favorite branch of the profession, and he
has not been at all sparing in reference to it. Under this head will be
included many topics which could more properly be placed in the chapter
on physiology, but it is thought better to have such intimate subjects
classed together. They have been arranged in the order of their natural
occurrence.</p>

<span class="i3"><i>Paris.</i>&emsp;Younger than she are happy mothers made.</span>
<span class="i3"><i>Capulet.</i> And too soon marr’d are those so early made.</span>

<span class="i6">That you are now a maid.</span>
<span class="i25"><i>Romeo and Juliet, Act I., Sc. III.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the old poem Juliet’s age is put down as sixteen; in Paynter’s novel
she is said to be eighteen. Shakespeare, however, makes her fourteen,
but who ever imagines her of these tender years while enjoying the
play? It seems absurd to think of her as being less than twenty or
twenty-two until we recollect that she grew and developed into early
womanhood under the sun of an Italian clime. The wonderful development
of the girls of Italy can easily be seen in the Eternal city. Taking a
stroll down to the Spanish staircase which is daily filled with Roman
models lazily awaiting the engagements of the artists, or a walk on the
Corso, or around the Theatre of Marcellus, convinces one at once that
Shakespeare’s Juliet, young as she is, is not overdrawn, and that the
Italian girl of fourteen is indeed fully “ripe to be a bride.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">’Tis a sad thing, I can not choose but say,</span>
<span class="i2">And all the fault of that indecent sun</span>
<span class="i2">Who can not leave alone our helpless clay,</span>
<span class="i2">But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,</span>
<span class="i2">That, howsoever people fast and pray,</span>
<span class="i2">The flesh is frail and so the soul’s undone:</span>
<span class="i2">What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,</span>
<span class="i2">Is much more common where the climate’s sultry.</span>
<span class="i11"><i>Byron—Don Juan, Canto I., Verse LXIII.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shakespeare has hinted several times that it was a common occurrence
for girls of this “sun-burnt nation” to be mothers at the age of
fourteen. Paris assures Juliet’s father that “younger than she are
happy mothers made,” and Lady Capulet, in her conversation with her
daughter, alludes to the fact that she was her mother when she was but
thirteen. She also echoes Paris in saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Younger than you</span>
<span class="i2">Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</span>
<span class="i2">Are made already mothers.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another reference is found in Winter’s Tale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If this prove true, they’ll pay for it: by mine honour,</span>

<span class="i30"><i>Act II., Sc. I.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Perhaps Byron had a better idea of this climatic effect than any other
poet. He has frequently written of it; indeed, it forms the foundation
of some of his poems.</p>

<p>Fecundation is not overlooked, and Shakespeare shows his knowledge of
the fact that the penis is merely the spout or funnel by which the
semen is conveyed to the uterus, and aptly compares the womb to a
bottle, which in his time gradually tapered toward the neck. The word
tundish is an old Warwickshire name for a funnel.</p>

<p>The production of either sex at will agitated the minds of
physiologists to a considerable extent during Shakespeare’s time.
Indeed he seems to have held an ancient theory that the more vigorous
of the parents produced the opposite sex. Dr. Robert, of Paris, in his
paper entitled <i>Megalanthropogenesis</i>, somewhat followed up this theory
and maintained that “the race of men of genius might be perpetuated by
uniting them to better physically developed women having clever minds,”
which, according to his theory, would, of course, result in nothing but
male children.</p>

<p>It is a very old opinion that the mental state of parents during
coition influenced to a certain extent the mental activity of the
offspring. Bastards were supposed to excel in this respect on account
of the mental excitement during the intercourse from which they took
their origin. Burton held this view in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,”
and, after reading King Lear, we know that Shakespeare also held it.</p>

<p>History records the fact that the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards

<p>The term “unlick’d bear-whelp,” in the last quotation, refers to an old
notion existing before Shakespeare’s time: that the bear brings forth
masses of animated flesh, having no resemblance whatever to her, and
that she then licks this shapeless lump into a cub. There is a thread
of truth running through this idea, as will be seen by the following
extract taken by Dyer from “Arcana Microcosmi,” by Alexander Ross:
“Bears bring forth their young deformed and misshapen, by reason of the
thick membrane in which they are wrapped, that is covered over with a
mucous matter. This, he says, the dam contracts in the winter-time,
by lying in hollow caves without motion, so that to the eye the cub
appears like an unformed lump. The above mucilage is afterwards licked
away by the dam, and the membrane broken, whereby that which before
seemed to be unformed appears now in its right shape.” Ross holds that
this was well known by the ancients and that they entertained no other
idea in regard to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackett, noticing the numerous allusions in Shakespeare to the
blood, and to a circulation of this fluid to and from the heart or
the liver, was led, in 1859, to express the absurd idea that William
Shakespeare had anticipated Harvey in the discovery of the circulation
of the blood.</p>

<p>Shakespeare died in 1610. Harvey first published his theory in 1619. It
must be remembered that at this time many ideas were afloat concerning
the circulation. Among the older theories were those of Hippocrates,
Praxagoras, and Erasistratus, who held that the arteries contained air,
and that, therefore, the <i>veins</i> were the <i>only</i> blood-holding vessels,
and that they had their origin in the liver. Galen, the most celebrated
of ancient medical writers, who lived as early as 150 A. D. taught that
the left ventricle of the heart was the common origin of all arteries,
and that the arteries of living animals contained blood, <i>not</i> air; but
he did not advance with his studies so as to learn in what direction
the blood flowed, or whether it was movable or stationary. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
distinguished Michael Servetus, who was burned with his books, by
order of Calvin, in 1553, taught that the blood flowed from the right
ventricle, through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, and thence
through the pulmonary vein and left auricle into the corresponding
ventricle from which it was conveyed by the aorta to all parts of
the body. Dr. Bucknill is of the opinion that Shakespeare followed
Hippocrates in his theory that the veins were the only blood vessels
and that they came from the liver. It is very evident, from the many allusions
given below, that he did at different periods adhere to this belief.</p>

<p>It is more reasonable to suppose that Shakespeare did not tie himself
down to any one theory concerning the circulation, but that sometimes
he had in mind the theory of Michael Servetus, (to which all the heart
allusions will apply), and at other times that of Hippocrates, (which
accounts for all the thoughts regarding the liver as the propeller of
the blood through the veins). The immortal Harvey was the first to
point out the true idea of the circulation: the idea that the blood
was forced by the heart through the arteries, a pure live-supporting
fluid; that it went to the extreme parts of the body, giving nutriment,
taking up impurities, and then returning by way of the veins to the
heart,—thence to the lungs to be purified before being again sent
out on it’s life-sustaining journey. None of the quotations from
Shakespeare express this idea, excepting perhaps one, and that rather
vaguely.</p>

<span class="i8">The tide of blood in me</span>
<span class="i2">Hath proudly flow’d in vanity, till now;</span>

<p>A few remaining physiological thoughts are interesting. As is well
known, we are much better able to judge the size and distance of

above or below us. When we view objects from a height they appear much
less than they would were we at the same distance from them on the same
level. Shakespeare has beautifully shown this effect in King Lear.</p>

He had some idea of the sympathetic connection between the organs of
the body, and has furnished us with a good example of superstition
connected with sympathy. It was an old superstition that the wounds of
a murdered person would bleed afresh if the body was touched by the
murderer, and this has nicely been brought out in Richard III.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry’s wounds</span>
<span class="i2">Open their congeal’d mouths and bleed afresh!</span>
<span class="i2">Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</span>
<span class="i2">For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood</span>
<span class="i2">From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells,</span>

<span class="i2">Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</span>
<span class="i40"><i>Act I., Sc. II.</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dunglison explains these superstitions “either on purely physical
principles, or on the excited imagination of the observer,” and cites
two interesting cases—one attested by John Demarest, coroner of
Bergen county, New Jersey, (1767), and the other which occurred near
Easton, Pennsylvania. Of the latter case he says: “The superstition
has, indeed, its believers among us. On the trial of Getter, who was
executed about five years ago (1833) in Pennsylvania, for the murder of
his wife, a female witness deposed on oath as follows: ‘If my throat
was to be cut, I could tell, before God Almighty, that the deceased
smiled when he (the murderer) touched her. I swore this before the
justices, and that she bled considerably. I was sent for to dress her
and lay her out. He touched her twice. He made no hesitation about
doing it. I also swore before the justice that it was observed by other
people in the house.’” Dyer cites a number of similar cases, and quotes
the following as a supposed cause of the phenomenon from the “Athenian
Oracle,” (1-106): “The blood is congealed in the body for two or three
days, and then becomes liquid again, in its tendency to corruption.
The air being heated by many persons coming about the body is the same
thing to it as motion is. ’Tis observed that dead bodies will bleed in
a concourse of people, when murderers are absent as well as present,
yet legislators have thought it fit to authorize it, and use this trial
as an argument, at least to frighten, though ’tis no conclusive one to
condemn them.” The practice, however, caused many an innocent spectator
to receive the fatal penalty.
